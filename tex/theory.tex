\subsection{Reflection and Transmission on a Simple Boundary at Normal Incidence}
    \begin{figure}

        \caption{Simple Boundary}
        \label{fig:simp}
    \end{figure}
    For an electromagnetic wave incident on a surface from index of refraction $n_0$ to $n_1$ at an angle $\theta_0$, the phase factors are given by
    \begin{align}
        &\text{Incident Wave} & &\mathrm{exp}\left\{ i [\omega t - (2\pi n_0 / \lambda)(x \sin \theta_0 - z \cos \theta_0)]\right\} \\
        &\text{Reflected Wave} & &\mathrm{exp}\left\{ i [\omega t - (2\pi n_0 / \lambda)(\alpha_r x + \beta_r y + \gamma_r z)]\right\} \\
        &\text{Transmitted Wave} & &\mathrm{exp}\left\{ i [\omega t - (2\pi n_1 / \lambda)(\alpha_t x + \beta_t y + \gamma_t z)]\right\}
    \end{align}
    This situation is schematically shown in Figure \ref{fig:simp}

    Let us temporarily consider light normally incident on the boundary. The electric field will be aligned along the positive x-direction, requiring the the magnetic field to be aligned along the positive y-axis. We apply the boundary conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Electric field vector continuous across boundary
        \begin{equation}
            E_i + E_r = E_t
        \end{equation} 
        \item Magnetic field vector continuous across boundary
        \begin{equation}
            H_i - H_r = H_t
            \label{eq:magcont}
        \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
    Figure \ref{fig:norm} pictorially shows these conditions.

    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[height=6cm]{simple_boundary_normal.png}
        \caption{Light Normally incident on surface with electric and magnetic vectors shown}
        \label{fig:norm}
    \end{figure}

    Using the characteristic admittance, $y$, of each layer, Equation \ref{eq:magcont} can be expressed as

    \begin{equation}
        y_0 E_i - y_0 E_r = y_1 E_t \label{eq:admit}
    \end{equation}

    We can then compute the reflection coefficient $\rho$ and the transmission coefficient $\tau$
    \begin{align}
        \rho &= \frac{E_r}{E_i} = \frac{y_0 - y_1}{y_0 + y_1} = \frac{n_0 - n_1}{n_0 + n_1} \\
        \tau &= \frac{E_t}{E_i} = \frac{2 y_0}{y_0 + y_1} = \frac{2 n_0}{n_0+n_1}
    \end{align}
    Where the last equality comes about since in the optical regime
    $$ y = n y_{\mathrm{vaccuum}} $$

    And finally, we compute the transmittance $T$ and reflectance $R$ by
    \begin{align}
        T &= \frac{y_1}{y_0}\tau^2 = \frac{4 n_0 n_1}{(n_0 + n_1)^2} \label{eq:trans} \\
        R &= \rho^2 = \left(\frac{n_0 - n_1}{n_0 + n_1}\right)^2 \label{eq:reflec}
    \end{align}

    As expected for a non-absorbing medium $$ T + R = 1 $$

\subsection{Reflection and Transmission at Oblique Incidence}
    To extend this analysis to oblique incidence, we introduce the tilted optical admittance $\eta$ which connects the components of the electric and magnetic fields parallel to the boundary
    \begin{equation}
        \eta = \frac{H^{\parallel}}{E^{\parallel}}
    \end{equation}
    Using this tilted admittance, the transmission and reflection coefficients can be computed the same way they are computed in equations \ref{eq:trans} and \ref{eq:reflec}.

    From here, we will drop the $\parallel$ symbol, and $E$ and $H$ will be understood to mean $E^\parallel$ and $H^\parallel$ respectively, unless otherwise noted.

    It is worthy to note that to calculating $\eta$ depends on the polarization of incident light. In the case of s and p-polarization, the tilted admittances become
    \begin{align}
        \eta_p &= y/\cos \theta \\
        \eta_s &= y \cos \theta
    \end{align}
    Also of note is that this analysis can be readily extended to absorbing media if $\theta$ is allowed to be complex.

\subsection{Reflection of a Thin Film}
    We turn our attention to the geometry seen in Figure \ref{fig:film}. We first consider the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields at boundary b, while introducing the notation $+$ referring to the positive-travelling wave and $-$ referring to waves traveling in the opposite direction.
    \begin{align}
        E_b &= E_{1b}^+ + E_{1b}^- \\
        H_b &= \eta_1 E_{1b}^+ - \eta_1 E_{1b}^-    
    \end{align}
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[height = 6cm]{thin_film.png}
        \caption{Plane wave incident on a thin film}
        \label{fig:film}
    \end{figure}
    We can find the fields at the interface at $a$ by considering the phase difference at the same time, across the change in the $z$ coordinate by $-d$. We say that the positive going wave will be multiplied by $e^{i \delta}$ while the negative going wave will be multiplied by $e^{-i \delta}$ where
    \begin{equation}
        \delta = 2 \pi N_1 d \cos \theta_1 / \lambda    
    \end{equation}
    $N$ is the complex analogue to the refractive index $n$ and is given by $$N = n - ik $$ where $k$ is the extinction coefficient. $k$ is related to the absorption coefficient $\alpha$ by 
    \begin{equation}
        \alpha = \frac{4 \pi k}{\lambda}
    \end{equation}
    
    With these tools, we can relate $E_a$ and $H_a$ to $E_b$ and $H_b$ by the matrix equation
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:charmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            E_a \\
            H_a
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \cos \delta & (i \sin \delta)/\eta_1 \\
            i \eta_1 \sin \delta & \cos \delta
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            E_b \\
            H_b
        \end{bmatrix}        
    \end{equation}
    
    It will be convenient to normalize this equation
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            E_a/E_b \\
            H_a/E_b
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            B \\
            C
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \cos \delta & (i \sin \delta)/\eta_1 \\
            i \eta_1 \sin \delta & \cos \delta
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 \\
            \eta_2
        \end{bmatrix}        
    \end{equation}
    The optical admittance of the assembly can be defined in an analogous way to what was used to write Equation \ref{eq:admit}
    \begin{equation}
        Y = \frac{H_a}{E_a} 
    \end{equation}
    and therefore
    \begin{equation}
        Y = \frac{C}{B} \label{eq:filmadmit}
    \end{equation}
    The reflectance of the thin film can then be written as
    \begin{equation}
        R = \left(\frac{\eta_0 - Y}{\eta_0 + Y}\right)\left(\frac{\eta_0 - Y}{\eta_0 + Y}\right)^* \label{eq:filmreflec}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \cos \delta & (i \sin \delta)/\eta_1 \\
            i \eta_1 \sin \delta & \cos \delta
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    is known as the \emph{characteristic matrix} of the film.   

\subsection{Reflectance of an Assembly of Thin Films}
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[height=6cm]{film_assembly.png}
        \caption{An assembly of thin films}
        \label{fig:assem}
    \end{figure}
    We turn our attention to the assembly found in Figure \ref{fig:assem}. By quick analogy with the previous section, is it readily seen that the characteristic matrix of the assembly is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            B \\
            C
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \left\{\prod_{r=1}^q
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \cos \delta_r & (i \sin \delta_r)/\eta_r \\
            i \eta_r \sin \delta_r & \cos \delta_r            
        \end{bmatrix}
        \right\}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 \\
            \eta_m            
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    The admittance and reflectance of the assembly are calculated as described before in (\ref{eq:filmadmit}) and (\ref{eq:filmreflec})

\subsection{Transmission through a Thin Film Assembly}
    We calculate the net irradiance leaving the assembly as
    \begin{align}
        I_k &= \frac{1}{2}\Re\left(E_k H_k^*\right) \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}\Re\left(\eta_m^*\right) E_k E_k^*
    \end{align}
    If the characteristic matrix of the assembly is
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            B \\
            C
        \end{bmatrix}        
    \end{equation*}
    The incident irradiance on the assembly is given by
    \begin{equation}
        I_a = \frac{1}{2}\Re\left(BC^*\right)E_k E_k^*        
    \end{equation}
    The transmittance is, as always, given by the ratio of incident irradiance to exit irradiance
    \begin{equation}
        T = \frac{I_k}{I_i} = \frac{\Re\left(\eta_m\right)(1-R)}{\Re\left(B C^*\right)}        
    \end{equation}
    which can be modified to
    \begin{equation}
        T = \frac{4 \eta_0 \Re(\eta_m)}{(\eta_0 B + C)(\eta_0 B + C)^*} 
    \end{equation}
    For the transmittance to have physical meaning, the incident medium must be transparent. That is, $\eta_0$ must be real

\subsection{Quarter and Half-Wave Thickness}
    Of considerable importance in thin film optical assemblies are layers where the optical thickness are an integer number of quarter waves. That is, if
    \begin{equation*}  
        \delta = \frac{m \pi}{2}, \text{	} m = 0, 1, 2, 3 \ldots
    \end{equation*}
    For $m$ even, the layer is an integer number of half wavelengths, and the matrix becomes
    \begin{equation*}
        \pm
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 \\
            0 & 1                        
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    This is the unity matrix, and therefore has no effect on the reflectance or transmittance of the assembly.

    For $m$ odd, the matrix becomes
    \begin{equation*}
        \pm
        \begin{bmatrix}
            0 & i/\eta \\
            i \eta & 0
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation*}
    Of more importance with the quarter wavelength layer is what happens in a multilayer film consisting of high-index and low-index layers. Light reflected within the low-index layers will experience a phase-shift of $\pi$, while light reflected in the high-index layers will not experience a phase shift. Therefore, all light coming off the front surface of the multilayer will be in-phase, and the film can have an extraordinarily high reflectance for a limited range of wavelengths. This phenomenon is of extreme importance to devices discussed later.

    Because thickness of quarter-waves are so useful and common for filter design, only layers that are integer multiple of quarter wavelengths will be considered going forward. This allows us to introduce a new notation. The letter H will represent a quarter-wave layer made of a material with a higher index of refraction, while L represents a layer with a lower index of refraction. For example, \ce{HLL} represents a structure where the incident light first hits a high refractive index, quarter-wave laver, followed by a half-wavelength layer of low refractive index material.

\subsection{Band-Pass Filters}
    To create a narrow-band filter, we consider a device based on the Fabry-Perot interferometer. A diagram of which is seen in Figure \ref{fig:etalon}.
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics[height=6cm]{etalon.png}
        \caption{A Fabry-Perot Etalon}
        \label{fig:etalon}        
    \end{figure}
    By replacing the reflective coatings with quarter-wave assemblies and instead of using a spacer, using a half-wave layer, an \emph{all-dielectric Fabry-Perot filter} can be created. The operating principle of this device is that light incident on the reflective coatings interferes in such a way that very strong peaks are seen at $\delta = m \pi$ where $\delta$, is defined as before $$ \delta = \frac{2 \pi n_s d_s \cos \theta_s}{\lambda} $$

    The transmittance of the etalon, under the assumption that there is no phase change on reflection, $n_s = 1$ and non-absorbing layers is
    \begin{equation}
        T = \frac{1}{1 + F \sin^2 \delta}
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation}
        F = \frac{4 R_s}{\left(1-R_s\right)^2}
    \end{equation}

    For the all-dielectric case, we assume that the reflectance is sufficiently high such that
    \begin{equation}
        F \approx \frac{4}{T^2}
    \end{equation}
    The \emph{resolving power} describes the height and width of the peak frequency of a band-pass filter. It is given by
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\lambda_0}{\Delta \lambda_h}
    \end{equation*}
    Under our assumptions
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\lambda_0}{\Delta \lambda_h} = \frac{m \pi F^{1/2}}{2} \approx \frac{m \pi}{T}
    \end{equation}

    We can now create Fabry-Perot filters using two reflecting layers of alternating refractive index, quarter-wave layers, separated by a half-wave layer. It can be shown that the layers will be of the highest reflectance if they end with the higher index of refraction, so there are two geometries to consider:
    \begin{align*}
        \ce{HLH} \cdots \ce{HLLH} \cdots \ce{HLH} \\
        \ce{HLH} \cdots \ce{LHHL} \cdots \ce{HLH}
    \end{align*}

    The peak transmittances become
    \begin{align}
        &\text{High-Index Spacer} &T &= \frac{4 n_L^{2x}}{n_H^{2x+1}}  \\
        &\text{Low-Index Spacer} &T &= \frac{4 n_L^{2x -1} n_s}{n_H^{2x}}       
    \end{align}
    
    And the resolving powers become
    \begin{align}
        &\text{High-Index Spacer} &\frac{\Delta \lambda_h}{\lambda_0} &= \frac{4 n_L^{2x} n_s}{m \pi n_H^{2x}}  \\
        &\text{Low-Index Spacer} &\frac{\Delta \lambda_h}{\lambda_0} &= \frac{4 n_L^{2x-1} n_s}{m \pi n_H^{2x}}
    \end{align}

\subsection{Effect of Tilting}
    The phase thickness of a thin film at oblique incident angle $\theta$ is
    \begin{equation}
        \delta = 2 \pi n d \cos \theta / \lambda        
    \end{equation}
    The position of the peak of an ideal Fabry-Perot filter with spacer layer index $n^*$ is
    \begin{equation}
        (2 \pi n^* d/\lambda_0) g \cos \theta = m \pi
    \end{equation}
    We'll restrict our attention to
    \begin{align*}
        g \cos \theta &= 1 \\
        \Delta g &= \left(\frac{1}{\cos \theta} - 1\right)
    \end{align*}
    For small angles of incidence the shift is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta g = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{\theta_i^2}{2 n^{*2}}        
    \end{equation}
